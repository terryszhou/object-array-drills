## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repo, and then cd into the cloned directory
* all of the challenges are in the `exercises.js` file

## Drills!

Make your way through `exercises.js`, answering the prompts. You can use `console.log()`s to test your answers and you can run the script with the command `node exercises.js` 

*Note that the answers are all in `answers.js`!* 

This point of this lab is not to just get the answers, the point is to work through the exercises yourself and use the answers as training wheels while you build your understanding.
